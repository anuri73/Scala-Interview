# General Questions:

* ### What did you learn yesterday/this week?

> As far as I know myself, I always try to learn something new and evolve in my professional career. Not only because of the specifics of our specialty (technologies are improving by leaps and bounds), but also because I like to learn and explore the world. Answering your question, I have been actively studying Apache Spark technology for the last month - what it is needed for and in what situations it can be useful.

* ### Why and how did you start learning Scala?

> I first heard about the scala in an article about machine learning, around January 2021. And I became so interested in it that I decided to try to study it. Since then, I have fallen in love with this language every day:
> - In its ability to write code in both OOP style and functional style.
> - In its vision and rich set of collections.
> - In its pattern matching.
> - In its call by name arguments and lazy vals
> - In its case classes
> - In its immutable objects
> - In its concurrency control
> - In its higher order functions And I strongly believe this list will be infinite as much as I will learn this technology. Because every part of language is thought out well.

* ### Mention advantages of Scala

> - It's highly scalable
> - It's highly testable
> - It's highly maintainable and productive
> - It's facilitates concurrent programming
> - It's both functional and OOP language

* ### What excites or interests you about coding in Scala?

> - In its ability to write code in both OOP style and functional style.
> - In its vision and rich set of collections.
> - In its pattern matching.
> - In its call by name arguments and lazy vals
> - In its case classes
> - In its immutable objects
> - In its concurrency control
> - In its higher order functions

* ### What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?

> The most important challenge for me now is switching from PHP to Scala. It's hard, but at the same time very exciting, because I have to re-learn everything from scratch. Think about programming from another side, another point of view. I am talking about functional programming, concurrency, JVM, memory allocation.

* ### Talk about your preferred development environment. (OS, Editor or IDE, Tools, etc.)

> Ubuntu, Intellij Idea / Visual Studio Code

* ### What are your thoughts about the other JVM languages compared to Scala?

> I am not yet confident enough to discuss it, because I have not compared them yet. But, I heard that Scala is Java with Sugar. And there is also already very know language called Kotlin, but now I devote all of myself to Scala. Maybe in the futureâ€¦

* ### Do you think that the Scala language and community is mature enough?

> Yes, for sure. There are already a lot of tools like Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Akka framework written in Scala language. A lot of library were written to develop enterprise projects. There are also a lot of people in community who could help you. I believe this community will be raised by time.
